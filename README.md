# The Odin Project: Shopping Cart

This project is about building a simple shopping website with a shopping cart. The project offers a chance to practice using react-router-dom along with Jest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, and @testing-library/user-event. Additionally, I spent some extra time switching from a manual Webpack and Babel configuration, to Vite, and finally settling on Create React App due to testing compatibility problems.
